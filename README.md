Cosmos Network fullnode and Lunie web Wallet

DAppNode is a web application and also the name of the hardware of an amazing project.
Its goal is to make it extremely easy to install and run blockchain applications and
full nodes.

What we have develop here is the DAppNode package that inclues a complete Cosmos Full Node
and its official web wallet, Lunie.
With this package you can have your own Cosmos full node and host your own clone of Lunie right at home.

The build process of the package is based on docker-compose and dappnode-sdk
